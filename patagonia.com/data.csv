The 2-way-adjustable, helmet-compatible hood includes a laminated visor for optimal visibility and a tall collar for neck and face protection in blowing snow. Low-profile pit zips release heat when you’re steaming on long climbs and a fully adjustable powder skirt (with webbing loop that attaches to any Patagonia® Snow pants) seals out spindrift and cold air. Other details include coated, watertight zippers with slim zip installation to reduce bulk and weight; cord-lock adjustments at the hood and hem; an embedded RECCO® avalanche rescue reflector; and a highly articulated fit for dynamic motion.

Built with a 100% recycled polyester GORE-TEX® face fabric, the Powder Bowl Pants provide tough, long-wearing waterproof/breathable and windproof protection for skiers and boarders who ride the mountain in all conditions. They feature a refined fit, streamlined styling and a rugged, 2-layer GORE-TEX® fabric, made from tenacious 100% recycled polyester, for exceptional waterproof/breathable and windproof performance in any condition. A DWR (durable water repellent) finish increases wet-weather performance by stopping snow and moisture so you can keep riding through the storm while the crowds call it a day. Inside, a combination of brushed mesh and polyester taffeta line the seat, upper thighs and down the legs to manage moisture and glide smoothly over underlayers. External mesh-lined thigh vents let you regulate your climate on the uptrack, and articulated knees provide unlimited mobility for spontaneous aerials (or recovering from said aerials). Other features include coated, watertight slim zips for reduced bulk, gaiters with tenacious gripper elastic, an embedded RECCO® avalanche rescue reflector, adjustable tabs at the waist for a customized fit burly scuff guards to protect the inside of the leg and hem from ski edges and postholing abuse, clean, simplified styling and a refined fit.

They’re made from solid weft 67% organic cotton/33% polyester T400® comfort stretch twill with a wicking finish that pulls moisture from the skin and repels water. They have classic 5-pocket styling with an antique-nickel shank-button closure and zip fly, double-needle belt loops, printed twill pocket bags and antique-nickel piton rivets throughout. The slim-straight fit sits on the waist with a regular rise. Best for lean-to-medium builds, they're neither too loose nor too tight through the seat and thighs, and cut straight from knee to ankle. Two front handwarmer pockets, a coin pocket on the right hip and two rear pockets carry your belongings. Pocket-edge seams are bound for a stronger and cleaner finish, and lower portions of both rear pockets are reinforced for durability. And they’re Fair Trade Certified™ sewn, which means the people who made them earned a premium for their labor.

A burly daypack with just the right amount of space to haul your daily essentials, our tough and highly weather-resistant Black Hole® Pack protects your gear from scuffs, scrapes and miles of rough handling. The large main pocket holds the lion’s share, with an internal padded sleeve that protects most 15"" laptops or holds a hydration reservoir, and a mesh pocket equipped with a key keeper and an organizer panel to hold your phone and small items. The bucket opening replaces a traditional lid and contains a small stash pocket that seals with a reverse-coil zipper. Daisy chain lash points secure a skateboard or yoga mat, and a stealthy zippered front pocket holds quick-access items. With padded shoulder straps for comfort and a molded back panel that sheds moisture and allows a cooling airflow.
